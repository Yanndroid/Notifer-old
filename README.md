# Notifer
This app will transfer notifications from selected apps on your phone to your WebSocket. It will send the title, message, package name, progress (if available) and notification id of the app and also it's icon's dominant color. The goal of this project was to light up RGB-lights, when receiving a message or a call, with the app icon's main color, but it also can be used for other purposes. Like all my apps it uses the OneUI design from my [library](https://github.com/Yanndroid/OneUI-Design-Library). You can download the latest apk [here](https://github.com/Yanndroid/Notifer/raw/master/app/release/app-release.apk), future updates are available directly via the app. If this app is installed as a system app, it will also show up in the system notification settings.
